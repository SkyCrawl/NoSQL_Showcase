##CQL

* (-) SQL/CQL doesn't seem to be very convenient - JPA does a much better job with ORM. Currently, there seem to be at least 1 or 2 Cassandra ORM wrappers under development.
* (-) There doesn't seem to be a nice way of referencing rows with compound keys that were just inserted into DB.
* (+) CQL parsing and error reporting is not bad, contains hints how to resolve errors.
